             within everyone, even though most people don`t take the time to find someone who truly respects them. 
             It seems like people are just looking for someone to show them the slightest amount of attention, setting
             for something much less than respect. I am convinced one of the best ways to help any relationship grow 
             is by showing respect.

           <p class="second_text ">
            I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected. What is respect? Respect is 
            showing someone extra specail attention, or high regard, based on a desire to show them how highly
            they are valued.
